# SpatialAnalyticsExam
Repository for Spatial Analytics in CDS

This project consists of a couple of data files:
- Geocoded music schools - Done manually
- Newspaper mentions of 'musikskole': LapsApi swagger, Statsbiblioteket - https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/labsapi/api//api-docs?url=/labsapi/api/openapi.yaml
- Population data: Source: Statistics Denmark – StatBank.dk/folk1am 
- Music student data: Source: Statistics Denmark – StatBank.dk/skolm02b  

The analysis involves an investigation of locations of historical 'musikskole' mentions and their relationship to modern music school locations in Denmark.
